Initial Phases Data
=======================

The Initial Phases Data consisted of 845 maps. Each map was produced from data
produced using SHELX with no feature enhancement. The commands used to do this can be
seen :ref:`below. <codeSHELXIP>` This was followed by the CCP4 functions 'f2map',
'cfft' and 'mapmask' called using a dispatcher, to convert to a tessalated map
format. This last step is done using the package TOPAZ. 

For the training data, a full fitting of the protein backbone must also be done
using SHELXe.

The images produced when training this model can be found in the same directory
as the model. 

.. _codeSHELXIP:

SHELX code for Initial Phases Data
--------------------------------------

The Initial Phases data is the '.phs' file containing the electron density
phases produced when using SHELXe to produce the electron density without any
feature enhancement. The full fitting of a protein backbone must also be done. 

To create the data in this form:

For each protein, first run SHELXc using an input file containing the lines
shown in the example below (replace relavant parts for new proteins):

  * TITL 4FDW_fa.ins MAD in P21221
  * CELL 0.9800 79.11 112.29 56.08 90.00 90.00 90.00
  * LATT -1
  * SYMM -X,Y,-Z
  * SYMM 1/2+X,-Y,1/2-Z
  * SYMM 1/2-X,-Y,1/2+Z
  * SFAC SE
  * UNIT 128
  * FIND 2
  * SHEL 999 2.4
  * MIND -1.5 -0.1
  * PATS
  * NTRY 1000
  * SEED 42
  * HKLF 3
  * END

This will produce a series of files with '_fa' in the name.

Then run SHELXd with these _fa files. This finds the heavy atom positions
and writes them to a '.hat' file. 

Next run SHELXe. This first uses the '.hat' file and runs one of the 
command below, then creates '_i.hat' and runs the same command for the 
inverse.

  * -s    solvent content
  * -m    cycles of solvent flattening: default=10
  * -h    heavy atoms intrinsic part of the protein. Either in the sequence or essentail metal: we assume all are Se (selenium)
  * -z    optimising heavy atom substructure
  * -a    number of autotracing cycles: here=5
  * -q    look for alpha helices
  * -e    free lunch algorithm

The command to run SHELXe for this data was as follows: 

.. code-block:: python3
    
   #for the backbone fitting
   shelxe{0}{1}-s{2}-m-h{3}-z{3}-a5-q.format(name, fa, solvent_frac,
   find)

   #for the initial phases data
   shelxe{0}{1}-s{2}-h{3}-z{3}.format(name,fa,solvent_frac,find)

Where: 

  * name --> PDB_id
  * fa --> files with _fa in name
  * solvent_frac --> solvent content as determined by Mathews coefficient
  * find --> number of heavy atoms to look for: determined by counting the  number of methionines (Ms) in the sequence and multiplying by the number of molecules expected for the ASU as determined by Mathews coefficient. 


Running this will produce the necessary files to run the prerequisite program
Topaz.
