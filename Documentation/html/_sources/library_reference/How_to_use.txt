How to use
===========
To use Eclip, it is simpest to run the training function (RunTrain), and then the
predicting function (RunPred). However, each function making up these can also be run
independantly. This allows for more flexibility in the arguments. 

The programs are run by calling the functions in the command line.

The functions able to be called are as follows: 


RunTrain
^^^^^^^^^
RunTrain is the module that produces a trained model, using input maps. Find the documentation for this module :ref:`here <RunTrain>`.
 
RunPred
^^^^^^^^
RunPred is the module that produces a score using a pretrained model. Find the
documentation for this module :ref:`here <RunPred>`.

ConvMAP
^^^^^^^^
ConvMAP is the module that converts maps to images. Find the documentation for
this module :ref:`here <ConvMAP>`.

EP_success
^^^^^^^^^^^^
EP_success is the module that updates the SQLite database with scores for the
training data, and links to the image directories. Find the documentation for
this module :ref:`here <EP_success>`.

learn
^^^^^^
learn if the module that trains a new model. Find the documentation for this
module :ref:`here <learn>`.

predictest
^^^^^^^^^^^
predictest is the module that tests the model on a testing set of proteins and
outputs statistices on its performance. Find the documentation for this module
:ref:`here <predictest>`.

predic
^^^^^^^
predic is the module that takes in a map file and outputs a score using a
pretrained model. Find the documentation for this module :ref:`here <predic>`.
