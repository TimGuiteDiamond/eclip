Heavy Atom Positions Data
=========================

The Heavy Atom Positions Data consisted of .... maps. Each map was produced from
data produced from SHELX after fully fitting the backbone. However, only the
information on the location of the heavy atoms were included. This was done to
see how well a model could perform on minimal information input, but is not 
guarrenteed to work with the heavy atom positions produced before fitting. The
commands used to do this can be seen :ref:`below. <codeSHELXHA>` This was
followed by the CCP4 functions 'f2map', 'cfft', and 'mapmask' called using a
dispatcher, to convert to a tessalated map format. This last step is done using
the package TOPAZ. 

The images produced when training this model can be found in the same directory
as the model.
