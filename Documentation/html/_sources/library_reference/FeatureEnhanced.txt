Feature Enhanced Data
=======================

The Feature Enhanced Data consisted of .... maps. Each map was produced from data
that first underwent full feature enhancement using SHELX, such that an attempt
on backbone fitting could have been made. The commands used to do this can be
seen :ref:`below. <codeSHELXFE>` This was followed by the CCP4 functions 'f2map',
'cfft' and 'mapmask' called using a dispatcher, to convert to a tessalated map
format. This last step is done using the package TOPAZ. 

The images produced when training this model can be found in the same directory
as the model.
